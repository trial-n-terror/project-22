## #1

The skill tree is the world map. 

 1A. capturing a node through gameplay lets you aquire a skill. Major nodes are aquired through completion, connected minor nodes (that upgrade the skill) are acquired by redoing that dungeon with restrictions.
 2B. Each node provides resources to use in your cauldron. The cauldron provides you with potions (skills, buffs and debuffs).

---

## #2

instead of killing enemies, you scare them away.

---

## #3

you walk around as a witch, corrupting your environment: grass patches that slow enemies, trees that grab/eat enemies, puddles that harbor tentacle-monsters, ...

---

## #4

Dying is a game-mechanic.

 4A. Dying lets you teleport to the center of the map. reviving you causes deformations to yourself (causing pros and cons) and corrupts the forest further (turning the flora and fauna of unconquered nodes more and more against you). Corruption emanates from the center of the forest outwards.
 4B. When you die, you lose the dungeon-tile.
 4C. Slaying enemies lets you gather souls. Resurrecting yourself requires x number of souls.

---

## #5

at the end of each dungeon, you can choose where the next attack will take place.

---

## #6

when you die, the node and its surrounding nodes are lost again.

---

## #7

Tower defense-like pathing, where you increase the 'scaryness' of your forest to change the path of attackers. Tougher enemies are less easily scared and take different routes through your forest.

---

## #8

You are presented with a map of tiles that looks like a nice, countryside, semi-medieval, forested area. Here you 'upgrade' tiles to make them part of your Dark Forest. Each tile is a dungeon to be entered, where the difficulty is determined by upgrade level and challenges are determined by the surrounding tiles.

 8A. Slaying enemies lets you gather souls. Souls are used to upgrade a tile. Whenever you upgrade a tile, you are presented with X amount of upgrade-choices.

---

## #9

The way you kill enemies, determines later choices in the game.

 9A. When upgrading a tile, you get specific tile upgrades depending on whether you used more scare-tactics or kill-tactics.

## #A

ideas #5, #7, #8

You start on an overview map, with your own tiny Dark Forest in the center. You can see tiles around your dark forest, further out is a fog that prevents you from seeing more.

A village that borders your forest sends out woodchoppers, unknowingly attacking your forest. You enter the tile that is getting attacked (which is a forest-tile) and go out to kill the woodchoppers, gathering their souls in the process.

After defeating the woodchoppers, you return to the overview map. The souls you've gathered can now be used to upgrade tiles: either you upgrade a tile you already own, making it more scary to invaders, or you upgrade a neighbouring tile to incorporate it into you forest.

---

Upgrading a tile presents you with 3 random choices, and will alter the parameters of the tile: type of scaryness, resources to farm here, ...

Upgrading a tile that isn't part of your forest always has invaders already there: the original inhabitants of the tile (e.g. forest critters in a forest tile, farmers in a field tile, villagers in a village tile, ...).

Some tiles are more dangerous to upgrade than others. More 'common' tiles (e.g. forest and field-tiles) present the least amount of danger. 'Uncommon' tiles (e.g. swamp-tiles) contain harder enemies.

---

When you expand your forest, the fog gets lifted piece by piece. Human-inhabited tiles (e.g. villages, monastaries, castles, ...) that are within sight (meaning tiles that aren't in the fog) will send out occasional attacks. These can be woodchoppers, witchhunters, crusaders, ... Depending on the tile they originate from, they vary in difficulty.

Dying lets you lose the tile you died on and its surrounding tiles.
